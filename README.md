# PG-Life

#Project Overview
"PG Life" is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding paying guest (PG) accommodations. This project was developed as part of the Web Development Internship course offered by Internshala. My goal was to create a user-friendly platform that helps students and professionals easily search for PGs based on location and provides detailed information for each listing.

#Key Features
Search Functionality: Users can search for PGs by city or neighborhood.

Detailed Listings: Each listing provides essential information, including photos, amenities, rental price, and contact details.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
